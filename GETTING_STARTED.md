# Getting started

### Pre-requisites

You need Python 3.6+. To download songs as MP3, you will need ffmpeg.  

- Linux users can get them by installing libav-tools by using apt-get `sudo apt-get install -y libav-tools`) or a package manager which comes with your distro
- Windows users can download FFMPEG pre-built binaries from [here](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). Extract the file using [7-zip](http://7-zip.org/) to a foldrer and [add the folder to your PATH environment variable](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows) 

1.  Install using pip

        pip3 install spotify_dl

2.  Login to [Spotify developer console](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications) and click on "Create an App". Fill in details for name and description

3.  Make a note of Client ID and Client Secret. These values need to be then set `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables respectively.

    You can set environment variables as mentioned below: 
    
    Linux:

            export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-client-id
            export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-client-secret

    Windows Powershell:
            $env:SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
            $env:SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
            
    Windows CMD:
            set SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-client-id
            set SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-client-secret

    See [this question](http://superuser.com/a/284351/4377) for more info,

4. Run the script using `spotify_dl`. spotify_dl accepts different parameters, for more details run `spotify_dl -h`. 

   For most users `spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist_link -o download_directory` should do where
   
   - `spotify_playlist_link` is a link to Spotify's playlist. You can get it from the 3-dot menu. 
    
    ![image](images/spotify-playlist.png)   
   
   spotify_dl also supports downloading multiple playlist, you can pass them like below:
   
   `spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist1 spotify_playlist2 -o download_directory`
   
    - `download_directory` is the location where the songs must be downloaded to. If you give a `.` then it will download to the current directory.

5.  To retrieve download songs as MP3, you will need to install ffmpeg. If you prefer to skip MP3 conversion, pass `-m` or `--skip_mp3` as a parameter when running the script

- Linux users can get them by installing libav-tools by using apt-get (`sudo apt-get install -y libav-tools`) if you'rte using a Debian/Ubuntu  or a package manager which comes with your distro
- Windows users can download FFMPEG pre-built binaries from [here](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). Extract the file using [7-zip](http://7-zip.org/) to a foldrer and [add the folder to your PATH environment variable](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)

   - `download_directory` is the location where the songs must be downloaded to. If you give a `.` then it will download to the current directory.
   
6. If you prefer to skip MP3 conversion, pass `-m` or `--skip_mp3` as a parameter when running the script
  
### Use Docker

Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile, run the following command in the spotify_dl root directory: `docker build -t spotify_dl .`

Run the Docker image with your client ID and secret:

```bash
docker run -d --rm \
		   -e SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=client_id \
		   -e SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret \
		   -v "download_directory":/download \
		   spotify_dl \
		   spotify_dl -l "spotify_playlist_link" -o /download
```

Replace `download_directory` with the path to the directory you want songs in. Set `"download_directory"` to `"$(pwd)"` to download to the current directory on Linux.

You can also run the bulk downloading script, make sure to configure it first: `bash bulk_docker_download.sh`

### How do I set defaults?

You can set defaults per user by creating a file at `~/.spotify_dl_settings`. Create a key with value for every argument you want a default for. Example:

```json
{
  "output": "/home/foo/spotify-dl-output",
  "verbose": "true",
  "skip_mp3": "t"
}
```
